# UART-PROTOCOL
Protocol: A set of rules and regulations is called a
protocol. Different type of protocols are available.
1.  Bus protocol: APB,AHB,AXI,ASB,ACE 
2. Peripheral protocol.
- High speed: PCIe, SATA, SAS, Ethernet, USB, MIPI.
- Low speed :UART,SPI,I2C.


- One of the biggest challenge in SOC design is the on chip communication between the different components.
-  The different bus protocols used for interconnection .
-  Most of the times, the IP cores are designed with many different interfaces and communication protocols and this can be a problem while integrating into an SOC. 
- To avoid this problem, standard on-chip bus structures and protocols were developed. Exchange of information from one system to another system with a medium is called communication.
-  A set of rules and regulations that allow two electronic devices to connect to exchange the data with one and another. 
-  Universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter (UART) is one of the simplest and oldest forms of device-todevice digital communication. You can find UART devices as a part of integrated circuits (ICs) or as individual components.
-   UART stands for a universal asynchronous transmitter and receiver. 
-  UART Protocols is a serial communication with two wired protocols. 
- The data cable signal lines are labelled as Rx and Tx.
-   Serial communication is commonly used for transmitting and receiving the signal.
- It is transferred and receives the data serially bit by bit without class pulses. 
-  The UART takes bytes of data and sends the individual bits in a sequential manner.
- UART is a half-duplex protocol. 
- Half-duplex means transferring and receiving the data but not at the same time. 
- It uses a single data line for transmitting and receiving the data. It has one start bit, 8-bit data and onestop bit mean the 8-bit data transfer oneâ€™s signal is high to low.

## Application Background

UART is one of the most simple and most commonly used Serial Communication techniques. Today, UART is being used in many applications like GPS Receivers, Bluetooth Modules, GSM and GPRS Modems, Wireless Communication Systems, RFID based applications etc.
